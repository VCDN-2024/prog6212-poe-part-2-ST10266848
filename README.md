## Assumptions and constraints that were added for Sprint 2:
- **Approval of claims:** It is assumed that the Programme Coordinator (PC) has to first approve a specific claim before the Academic Manager (AM) can approve it.
- **Lecturer View:** It is assumed that the Lecturer should not have the ability to edit or delete but instead they can email HR to potentially delete their claim.
- **Documents**: It is assumed that the upload of supporting documents for a certain claim is optional as some claims may not need such a requirement.
- **Rejection of claims** It is assumed that when a claim is rejected, it should be removed from the database.

## Users and Roles:
- Users and roles have been set up, using Microsoft's AspNetCore Identities
- There are 4 roles: Lecturer, Programme Coordinator, Academic Manager and HR

## Explanation of Lecturer Claim View:
- This view is where lecturers can view the details of the claims they have submitted (such as Hours Worked, hourly rate, the name of any supporting documents that may be there as well as a download link for said documents)
- If they have not submitted any yet, they can simply do so by pressing the viewable 'Submit Claim' button.
- After submitting a claim, details related to the claim will populate the table and the user will be provided with a view button next to the claim to view it's details in a better way.
- When a specific lecturer is signed in to the CMCS, the Lecture Claim View will only display the claims that they have submitted so not all claims submitted by all lecturers.

## Explanation of Submit Claim View:
- When a lecturer presses the 'Submit Claim' button they will be taken to this view.
- This view allows them to enter details for the claim such as Hours Worked, Any additional notes they may have as well as potential supporting documents they would like to upload.
- Once details have been entered and a document has been selected or not, the lecturer can then press the 'Submit' button to actually submit their claim, redirecting them back to the LecturerClaim view as well as populating it with any claims they may submit
- There is validation to ensure that the lecturer's inputs are correctly formatted before storing them in their respective fields in the Claims table in the local SQL database.

## Explanation of Pending Claim View:
- This view displays all submitted claims that have a status of "Pending" to the PC and AM as well as providing them with 'Approve' and 'Reject' buttons, each triggering their respective action methods in the ClaimsController.
- When a claim's status changes either as a result of the claim being approved or rejected, it will no longer show up in this view.

### Approve Claim Action Method:
- For a claim to be 'approved', both the PC and AM must approve the claim but the PC has first approve of the claim before the AM can approve it.
- 
#### There are several error-handling cases for this method:
- If the PC approves of a claim and the AM approves of the same claim, the claim is approved and its status is changed to "Approved" (this is then reflected in the database also)
- If the PC has already approved of claim and tries to approve it again, they will be taken to a view, alerting them that they have already approved the claim.
- If the AM tries to approve a claim before the PC does, an error message view will be returned, alerting them that they should wait for the PC to approve it first before also approving of it themselves.
- If the AM approves a claim that has been approved by the PC, a success message view will be returned, letting them know that the claim is now fully approved since both the PC and AM approved it - the claim status is set to "Approved" as a result.

### Reject Claim Action Method:
- For a claim to be "Rejected", either the PC or AM must reject the claim.
- Currently, when a claim is rejected, its status is changed to "Rejected" which is reflected in the database.
- As a result of it being rejected, the claim is then removed from the database as there is no longer a need for it.

# Sprint 1 - Part 1 Project Documentation:
## Overview:
This Contract Monthly Claims System (CMCS) allows lecturers to submit claims (by entering details such as the hours they have worked, their hourly rate and any additional notes as well as allowing them to select a file or two to support theirn claim) for approval. The app tracks whether their claim has been approved or rejected.  A coordinator, manager and HR member can approve or reject a lecturer's claim. A HR member can also manage a lecturer's data if they have received an update request from them. The app is built using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture in C#.

## 1. Design Choices:
### 1.1. MVC Architecture:
#### 1.1.1. MVC consists of the following:
* Model: Responsible for managing the application’s data and it's business logic, including claim information, statuses, documents and lecturer data (Open AI, 2024).
* View: Represents the user interface (UI), which displays data such as the claims, their statuses and supporting documents (Open AI, 2024).
* Controller: Handles user input, utilizes the model, and updates the view, managing workflows such as submitting claims, updating their status and managing lecturer data (Open AI, 2024).

#### 1.1.2. Why MVC?
* I chose MVC because it is more flexible, efficient, reliable, better at web development, less prone to randomly breaking and easier to work with than WPF.

### 1.2. Language and Framework
* Language: C# due to it's flexible and compatible nature with the .NET framework and MVC architecture.
* Framework: Due to it's seperation of concerns, we chose ASP.NET NVC, making the app easier to manage and scale.

## 2. Database Structure:
### 2.1 Tables
* Claims
    * Claim_Id (Primary Key, Auto-Increment): Unique identifier for each claim.
    * Hours_Worked (double): Number of hours a lecturer worked
    * Hourly_Rate (double): Rate a lecturer makes per hour
    * Addition_Note (string): A description related to the claim
    * Document (Byte Array): The actual document(s) stored as a byte array.
    * isApproved (Boolean): A boolean value representing the claim status (true for "Approved", false         for "Rejected").
    * Date_Submitted (DateTime): The date when the claim was submitted.

* Lecturer
    * Lecturer_Id (Primary Key, Auto-Increment): Unqiue identifier for each lecturer.
    * First_Name (string): First name of lecturer.
    * Surname (string): Surname of lectuer.
    * Email (string): Email of lecturer.
    * Password (string): Password of lecturer.
    
#### NOTE: The data structure for Coordinator, Manager and HR tables respectively is similar to the Lecturer table with the main difference being that each table has their own id and the attributes store data for a different type of user. 

### 2.2 Relationships:
* Coordinator, manager and HR users inherit from generic User table.
* One and only one lecturer can submit one or many claims.
* One and only one coordinator/manager/HR can approve or reject zero or many claims.

## 3. GUI Layout:
### 3.1. Landing View:
![CMCS Welcome Landing Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5181271-38d2-428d-aa7a-a48edbdc1ec7)
* As soon as one visits the CMCS, they are presented with page with 2 buttons:
* Register button allows them to create an account if they don't have one already
* Login button allows a user to enter the system proper.

### 3.2. Registration View:
![User Reg Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/473fbf3c-2018-451d-9f63-52296764363b)
* One would be able to register for an account here by entering details such as their first name, surname, email and password.
* However, their email must be their academic email or an email already associated with their role (Lecturer, Coordinator, Manager and HR)

### 3.3.1. Lecturer Home View:
![Lecturer Home Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fce18893-6652-40b1-8305-bc8a723a4440)
* This view informs the lecturer of how the claims approval process works and what role they play in that.
* This view includes a 'Claims' button, which once pressed, it redirects the user to the 'Claims' view where they will be able to submit a claim.

### 3.3.2. Coordinator and Manager Home View:
![PC and AM Home Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13c289b9-f5f8-45e6-9946-49c7805ea1da)
* These view informs the coordinator or manager and HR of their duties and responsiblities.
* This view includes a 'Claims' button, which once pressed, it redirects the user to the 'Pending Claims' view which displays all submitted claims, along with 'Approve' and 'Reject' buttons (which do as they say) next to them.
* Before rejecting a claim, the coordinator or manager would be given a confirmation dialog asking whether they are sure or not.

![HR Home Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aecf54f7-f2d7-42cf-a16e-3ea30c2cc2e2)
* In addition to being able to approve or reject claims as described in the previous view, a HR user can manage and update the data of a lecturer upon request through the press of the 'Manage Lecturer' button

### 3.4 Claims View:
![Lecturer Claims Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f44e18e2-eb61-4c01-9d2d-90d7bad65ec5)
* All claims that a lecturer has submitted will be displayed here.
* If no claims have been submitted yet, the lecturer is alerted of such by an appropriate message.
* If the lecturer wishes to submit a claim, they can do so by pressing the 'Submit a Claim' button.

### 3.5 Submit A Claim View:
![Submit a Claim Page](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d41d0e1-005b-44bc-8e2d-6e1a24768b29)
* After the Lecturer has navigated to this page, they will be able to enter all the necessary claim details, and submit a claim, through the use of the following elements:
   * A text field is provided for each claim attribute input (Hours_Worked, Hourly_Rate and Additional_Note).
   * Document upload: File upload control for supporting documents.
   * Submit button: Allows user to submit claim once all data is input.

## 4. Assumptions:
- **Submission of Claims:**  Each lecturer can submit one or more claims with some restrictions in place. Lecturers can submit their claims at any time of the day but they must submit their monthly claims before the 15th of each month otherwise they will be locked out of the claim submission feature until it is available again at the end of the month. 
- **Uploading of Documents:** The app would ensure that documents are stored securely and are connected to the corresponding claim. 
 - **Data Integrity**: It is assumed that all input data  (such as hours worked and hourly rate) will be provided in a proper format and will be validated before being stored in the database.
- **Pending Claims**  Coordinators and managers will have a separate view where all pending claims are displayed, along with the necessary details and options will be provided to allow them to verify or reject these claims
- **Checking of claims against predefined criteria:** The app assumes that feature is a filtering feature that allows coordinators and managers to search for or display specific claims that meet a certain criteria.
- **HR:** It is assumed that the HR users have already been registered into the system and thus given access to the system and documents.
- **Generation and Viewing of Invoices** The app assumes that the invoices summarizing the approved claims are generated automatically and the app will allow HR users to view these invoices.
- **Data Management of Lecturers:** It is assumed that Lecturers will notify HR of any changes of their personal information or contact details by sending HR an email (provided they use the same email they registered as Lecturer with). The HR view would have the necessary functionality to allow HR to successfully update the lecturer's personal and contact information. Once done with updating lecturer data, HR will send a confirmation email to the Lecturer.
- **Security:** The required security measures have been implemented to prevent unauthorized access to the database and uploaded documents. This would ensure only authorized users will have access.

## 5. Constraints:
- **Claim Submission Limit:** Once a claim is submitted, the lecturer cannot submit another one until the current one is either approved or rejected by a coordinator and manager.
- **File Size & Type Limit:** Only files up to a certain file size and of a common file type are allowed to be uploaded for each claim. This may be due to database storage constraints or application settings. 
- **Database Performance:** Performance could be impacted when large numbers of documents are stored  in the form of byte arrays in the database, especially if the database grows significantly in size.
